**AqNWB is currently under active development and should not yet be used in practice.**

AqNWB is a C++ API for acquiring neurophysiological data directly into the NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) format.
Our goal is to provide a lightweight API to integrate with existing acquisition systems.

Please see the [AqNWB Documentation](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/aqnwb/) for 
installation instructions and to learn more about AqNWB.

Below is a high-level overview of the project structure and capabilities we are targeting:
