 * \section testing_unit Unit Tests
 *
 * `AqNWB` uses `ctest` and `CATCH2` for unit testing.
 *  Relevant files for the unit tests are located at:
 *  * ``/tests`` : Sources of the unit tests
 *  * ``/tests/examples`` : Sources of example code used in the docs. The examples are implemented like
 *    regular unit tests but their purpose is to provide examples for the docs (rather than testing
 *    specific cases) and as such commonly include Doxygen section markers to allow inclusion of sections
 *    of code in the Doxygen docs.
 *
 *
 * \subsection testing_unit_run Running Unit Tests
 *
 * If you built AqNWB with the `dev` mode preset, then simply call:
 *
 *  \code{.sh}
 *  ctest --preset=dev
 *  \endcode
 *
 * Alternatively go to your build directory and run ``ctest`` directly, e.g.:
 *
 *  \code{.sh}
 *  cd <my_build_dir>
 *  ctest
 *  \endcode
 *
 * \subsection testing_github Automated tests on GitHub
 *
 * AqNWB uses GitHub Actions defined in the [.github/workflows](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/tree/main/.github/workflows) 
 * folder to automatically run all unit tests, spellchecks, linter, etc. on all pull requests.  
 * 
 * \note
 * For pull requests, **GitHub Actions often checks out a temporary merge commit**. 
 * This commit represents the state of the code as if the pull request were to be merged 
 * into the target branch (usually ``main``). This allows the CI to test the combined code
 * without actually merging it. These temporary merge commits are not part of the repository's
 * history and exist only in the context of the CI job. That is, if you are experiencing errors
 * in the CI but the indicated lines of code do not match the code in the PR, then this is 
 * likely due the PR being out-of-sync with the target branch of the PR. 

 *
 * \section testing_spellcheck Spellcheck
 *
 * AqNWB uses ``codespell`` to check the code for spelling errors. You can run the spellchecker via:
 *
 * \code{.sh}
 *  cmake --build --preset=dev --target=spell-check
 * \endcode
 *
 * To automatically fix spelling errors you can run codespell via the `spell-fix` target instead:
 *
 * \code{.sh}
 *  cmake --build --preset=dev --target=spell-fix
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note
 * ``codespell`` uses a relatively small dictionary of common misspellings and their corrections. For
 * more comprehensive spellchecking (in particular of the documentation) additional spellchecking via more
 * detailed spellcheckers (e.g., ``aspell``) is recommended.
 *
 * \section testing_lint Linting
 *
 * AqNWB uses ``clang-format`` for linting the code. You can run the linter via:
 *
 * \code{.sh}
 *  cmake --build --preset=dev --target=format-check
 * \endcode
 *
 * To automatically fix formatting errors you can run the linter via the `format-fix` target instead:
 * \code{.sh}
 *  cmake --build --preset=dev --target=format-fix
 * \endcode
 *
