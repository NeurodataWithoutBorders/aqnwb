 * \section demos_inspect_electrical_series Inspect Electrical Series Data using AqNWB
 *
 * This is a simple C++ demo project that shows how to read and analyze NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) files 
 * using the AqNWB library. The demo reads a NWB file and performs basic statistical analysis on 
 * the \ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectricalSeries "ElectricalSeries" electrophysiology data.
 *
 * **üìÅ Source:**
 * This demo is part of the [AqNWB repo](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb). 
 * For details see the ``demo/inspect_electrical_series/README.md`` docs.

 * \section demos_labmetadata_extension Integrating LabMetaData Extension with AqNWB 
 *
 * This demo app shows how we can implement and use an extension to NWB via AqNWB. Specifically, this
 *  example shows how we can:
 * 1. Create C++ header files for extension schema
 * 2. Integrate extension schema with AqNWB (incl. automatic caching of the schema on write)
 * 3. Implement `RegisteredType` classes to represent the new `neurodata_type`s defined in the extension
 * 4. Use the extension for writing and reading data
