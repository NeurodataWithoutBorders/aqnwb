 * \section recording_workflow Overview of a recording workflow
 *
 * For users wanting to integrate NWB with a particular data acquisition software, here
 * we outline the steps for a single recording from file creation to saving.
 *
 * 1. Create the I/O object (e.g,.  \ref AQNWB::IO::HDF5::HDF5IO "HDF5IO") used for
 *    writing data to the file on disk.
 * 2. Create the \ref AQNWB::NWB::RecordingContainers "RecordingContainers" object
 *    used for managing \ref AQNWB::NWB::Container "Container" objects for storing recordings.
 * 3. Create the \ref AQNWB::NWB::NWBFile "NWBFile" object used for managing and creating NWB
 *    file contents.
 * 4. Create the recording metadata stored in ``/general`` in NWB, e.g., the  
 *    \ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectrodeTable "ElectrodeTable" object used for 
 *    saving electrodes information. 
 * 5. Create the \ref AQNWB::NWB::Container "Container" objects (e.g.,
 *    \ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectricalSeries "ElectricalSeries") used for recording and add them
 *    to the \ref AQNWB::NWB::RecordingContainers "RecordingContainers".
 * 6. Start the recording.
 * 7. Write data.
 * 8. Stop the recording and close the \ref AQNWB::NWB::NWBFile "NWBFile".
 *
 * Below, we walk through these steps in more detail.

 *
 *
 * \subsection create_io 1. Create the I/O object.
 *
 * First, create an I/O object (e.g., \ref AQNWB::IO::HDF5::HDF5IO "HDF5IO") used for writing
 * data to the file. AqNWB provides the convenience method, \ref AQNWB::createIO "createIO"
 * to create this object using one of the supported backends. For more fine-grained
 * control of different backend parameters, you can create your own `std::shared_ptr`
 * using any of the derived \ref AQNWB::IO::BaseIO "BaseIO" classes.
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_io_snippet
 *
 *
 * \subsection create_recording_container 2. Create the RecordingContainer object.
 *
 * Next, create a \ref AQNWB::NWB::RecordingContainers "RecordingContainers"  object to manage the
 * different \ref AQNWB::NWB::Container "Container" objects with the datasets that you would
 * like to write data to.
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_recording_containers_snippet
 *
 *
 * \subsection create_nwbfile 3. Create the NWBFile
 *
 * Next, constructs the \ref AQNWB::NWB::NWBFile "NWBFile"  object, using the I/O object as an input.
 * Then, initialize the object to create the basic file structure of the NWBFile.
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_nwbfile_snippet
 *
 *
 * \subsection create_recmeta 4. Create the recording metadata 
 * \subsubsection create_recmeta_ecephys Create the extracellular recording metadata
 * Next, construct the \ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectrodeTable "ElectrodeTable" object, 
 * using the `recordingArrays` as an input. Note that in many cases, you will be recording from 
 * all electrodes detected by the device and this `recordingArrays` structure will be the same as
 * is used to create the \ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectricalSeries "ElectricalSeries". However in some cases
 * (e.g. when using Neuropixels or multiple probes), you may be recording from a subset of 
 * all available electrodes as part of a single \ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectricalSeries "ElectricalSeries". In this case,
 * you should create the ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectrodesTable "ElectrodesTable" with all electrodes
 * detected by the acquisition system, not just those being actively recorded from. This approach is
 * critical for mapping information about which \ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectricalSeries "ElectricalSeries"
 * were recorded from which electrodes.
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_electrodes_table_snippet
 * 
 *
 * \subsection create_datasets 5. Create datasets and add to RecordingContainers.
 *
 * Next, create the different data types (e.g. \ref AQNWB::NWB::ElectricalSeries "ElectricalSeries"
 * or other AQNWB::NWB::TimeSeries "TimeSeries") that you would like to write data into. After
 * creation, these objects are added to the  \ref AQNWB::NWB::RecordingContainers "RecordingContainers"
 * object so that it can mana ge access and data writing during the recording process.
 * When adding containers, ownership of the \ref AQNWB::NWB::Container "Container"  is transferred to the
 * \ref AQNWB::NWB::RecordingContainers "RecordingContainers" object, so that we can access it again via
 * its index. New containers will always be appended to the end of the private member
 * ``RecordingContainers::m_containers`` object and their index can be tracked
 * using the \ref AQNWB::NWB::RecordingContainers::size "RecordingContainers.size" of the input `recordingArrays`.
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_datasets_snippet
 *
 *
 * \subsection start_recording 6. Start the recording.
 *
 * Then, start the recording process with a call to the ``startRecording`` function of the I/O object.
 *
 *  \note
 * When using \ref AQNWB::IO::HDF5::HDF5IO "HDF5IO" for writing to HDF5, calling
 * \ref AQNWB::IO::HDF5::HDF5IO::startRecording "startRecording" will by default enable
 * \ref hdf5io_swmr "SWMR mode" to ensure file integrity and support concurrent read.
 * As a result, no additional datasets or groups can be added to the file once a recording
 * has been started unless the file is is closed and reopened.
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_start_snippet
 *
 *
 * \subsection write_data 7. Write data.
 *
 * During the recording process, use the \ref AQNWB::NWB::RecordingContainers "RecordingContainers"
 * as an interface to access the various  \ref AQNWB::NWB::Container "Container" object and corresponding
 * datasets and write blocks of data to the file. Calling `flush()` on the I/O object at any time will
 * ensure the data is moved to disk.
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_write_snippet
 *
 *
 * \subsection stop_recording 8. Stop the recording and finalize the file.
 *
 * When the recording process is finished, call `stopRecording` from the I/O object
 * to flush any data and close the file.
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_stop_snippet
 *
 *
 * \section advanced_recording_workflow Advanced: Recording individual datasets
 *
 * In the above workflow we used convenience methods, e.g., 
 * \ref AQNWB::NWB::RecordingContainers::writeTimeseriesData "RecordingContainers::writeTimeseriesData" 
 * to ensure data is being recorded in a consistent manner such that data and timestamps
 * are both updated at the same time to ensure the recording is consistent. For finer-grained
 * control to record into individual datasets directly, we can use the corresponding 
 * record methods, e.g., \ref AQNWB::NWB::TimeSeries::recordData "TimeSeries.recordData" to 
 * retrieve the current \ref AQNWB::IO::BaseRecordingData "BaseRecordingData" object for 
 * writing data to the datasets. The \ref AQNWB::IO::BaseRecordingData "BaseRecordingData" 
 * object for all datasets that belong to a recording container are cached by the 
 * \ref AQNWB::NWB::RegisteredType "RegisteredType" base class to ensure that the current
 * state of the recording process (e.g., the \ref AQNWB::IO::BaseRecordingData::getPosition() "position")
 * are stored. With this we can manually write individual data blocks ourselves while 
 * ensuring continuation of the recording process:
 *
 * \snippet tests/examples/testWorkflowExamples.cpp example_workflow_advanced_snippet
 *
 * \subsection advanced_recording_workflow_reset Resetting the recording position
 *
 * If we want to clear the recording cache, we can do so
by calling \ref AQNWB::NWB::RegisteredType::clearRecordingDataCache "electricalSeries0->clearRecordingDataCache()".
 * In this case the cached \ref AQNWB::IO::BaseRecordingData "BaseRecordingData" object will be 
 * deleted, such that the next time we request it, a new \ref AQNWB::IO::BaseRecordingData "BaseRecordingData"
 * object will be constructed that will then start again writing values from the beginning of the dataset.
 *
