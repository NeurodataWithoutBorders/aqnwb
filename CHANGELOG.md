## [Unreleased]

### Added
* Python Utility enhancements:
    * Added `aqnwb-utils` as a command-line utility to provide a common interface for aqnwb command line tools, e.g., `schematype_to_aqnwb.py` and `generate_spec_files.py`. (@oruebel, [#227](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/227))
    * Added inline script metadata (PEP 723) to Python utilities to enable direct execution with `uv run` without installation (@oruebel, [#229](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/229)
    * Added `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging support (@oruebel, [#229](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/229)

### Changed
* Updated Python utilities to use `uv` instead of `pip` for dependency management and updated docs and github workflows to use uv (@oruebel, [#227](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/227)
* Updated documentation to refer to the new `aqnwb-utils` command-line utility (@oruebel, [#227](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/227))
* Enhanced the `schematype_to_aqnwb` utility script:
    * Generated source files are now placed into a folder hierarchy based on the name of the namespace and schemafile of the neurodata_type (@oruebel, [#224](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/224))
    * Added functionality to optionally create a simple example app that instantiates all generated classes to help test that all generated classes can be compiled (@oruebel, [#225](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/225))
    * Updated generation of header files to ensure proper compilation, e.g.: i) identify and include the headers of all neurodata_types that are being used, ii) fix formatting of comments to avoid nested multi-line comments, iii) fixed issues with incomplete typenames  (@oruebel, [#225](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/225))
    * Added GitHub action testing that all sources files generated by the `schematype_to_aqnwb` utility for the nwb-schema and LabMetaDataExtension example can be compiled (@oruebel, [#225](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/225))

    * Updated the rendering of initialize methods to ensure inclusion of all owned parameters (including those in subgroups), add rendering of default values, and add rendering of suggested initialization code (@oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230))
    * Updated the rendering of initialize cpp source to create the correct call to the parents initialize method @oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230)
    * Updated rendering of read/record methods via DEFINE_FIELD macros  to ensure inclusion of all owned parameters (including those in subgroups), consistent with the updates to the initialize methods (@oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230))
    * Refactored code to generated initialize methods to centralize logic and make the code more robust. E.g., created new `get_initialize_method_parameters` to compile parameter details in one place and split the  `render_initialize_method`  into two functions. (@oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230))
    * Enhanced the new `get_initialize_method_parameters` method and rendering functions to correctly track the full path of objects (@oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230))
    * Added support for rendering DEFINE_REFERENCED_REGISTERED_FIELD macros for attributes that are references (@oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230))
    * Added rendering of virtual destructor in the header source (@oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230))
    * Updated generated initialize methods to always return a Status (@oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230))
    * Updated new `get_initialize_method_parameters` to ensure for neurodata_types that are Datasets that we include the dataset itself as a custom parameter that needs initialization (@oruebel, [#230](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/230))

### Fixed
* Resolved various compiler warnings on Windows (`-Wmaybe-uninitialized`, `-Wsign-conversion`, `-Wconversion`, `-Wshadow`, `-Wdeprecated-copy`, `-Wcatch-value`) and fixed cross-platform build issues related to `std::filesystem` linkage. (@oruebel, [#233](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/233))
