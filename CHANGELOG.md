## [Unreleased]

### Changed
* Enhanced the `schematype_to_aqnwb` utility script:
    * Generated source files are now placed into a folder hierarchy based on the name of the namespace and schemafile of the neurodata_type (@oruebel, [#224](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/224))
    * Added functionality to optinally create a simple example app that instantiates all generated classes to help test that all generated classes can be compiled (@oruebel, [#225](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/225))
    * Updated generation of header files to ensure proper compilation, e.g.: i) identify an include the headers of all neurodata_types that are being used, ii) fix formatting of comments to avoid nested multi-line comments, iii) fixed issues with incomplete typenames  (@oruebel, [#225](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/225))
    * Added GitHub action testing that all sources files generated by the `schematype_to_aqnwb` utility for the nwb-schema and LabMetaDataExtension example can be compiled (@oruebel, [#225](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/aqnwb/pull/225))
